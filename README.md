# SwiftUI Photos App  

* To run this app, its pretty straight forward with just resolving dependancies via swift package manager.
* I have made architecture simple for this coding challenge, used MVVM.
* Features of the app
    1. Grid of images Screen
    2. Image detail Screen
    3. Adding and removing favourites
    4. ImageCaching


## Folder Structure

| Folder  | Content |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Scenes        | All the screens     |
| Network       | Network layer and Endpoints ( in this case just one )     |


# Concepts Used

* MVVM as an UI Architecture pattern
* Combine

# External Libraries
* Nuke - image loading and caching made easy (https://github.com/kean/Nuke)
